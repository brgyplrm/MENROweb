📝 Description:
A simple educational website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is my first web development project, focusing on the Philippine Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Office (MENRO), key DENR environmental laws, and interactive quizzes to help users review and learn. The goal is to promote awareness and understanding of environmental protection efforts in the Philippines.
